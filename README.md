This is a JavaScript mini project done without any frameworks to practice concepts learnt.

**Newer Concepts**
Making use of spread operators
Use of .sort and Math.random to shuffle cards
Understanding that insertAdjacentHTML changes the img source to page url instead of assets path
Resolution of game bugs via use of debugger and console.logs
3D CSS effects like transform-rotate, and preserve-3d


**Getting Started**
Done using Parcel

"npm install" 
"npm run start"
Open http://localhost:1234 with your browser to see the result.


**Rules of game**
1. Start/Shuffle of cards [img 1]
2. Only 2 cards can be opened at any one time. When they arn't matching, they will be unflipped. [img 2]
3. Cards that have matched remain opened, and clicking on them does nothing. You also can't manually unflip cards, you'd have to flip till the two card requirement before they unflip on their own. [img 3]
